ðŸ”§ QUICK FIX FOR YOUR UPLOAD ISSUE:

The problem is session storage. Here's what to do:

1. Go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/debug
2. Test the simple upload form there
3. If that works, the main issue is JavaScript
4. If that doesn't work, the issue is session storage

IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:
================
Replace the session storage with file storage.

In integrated_advanced_cattle_system.py, find this line:
    session['results'] = results
    
And replace it with:
    import json
    with open('latest_results.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(results, f)

Then in the results route, replace:
    results = session.get('results', {})
    
With:
    try:
        with open('latest_results.json', 'r') as f:
            results = json.load(f)
    except:
        results = {}

This will bypass the session issue completely.
