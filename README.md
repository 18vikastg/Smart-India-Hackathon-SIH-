# Cattle/Buffalo Physical Feature Analysis System

## Overview
This is a comprehensive livestock breed identification expert tool that helps you analyze cattle and buffalo images for detailed physical characteristics. The system provides structured analysis templates and interactive tools to systematically examine key breed identification features.

## üéØ What This System Does

**Analyzes ALL visible physical characteristics:**
- Coat color and pattern (solid, spotted, patches)
- Horn shape (straight, curved, lyre-shaped, polled) 
- Ear size and shape (small, medium, large, droopy)
- Forehead profile (flat, convex, dished)
- Body build (compact, lean, muscular)
- Hump presence and size
- Dewlap characteristics
- Tail switch color
- Muzzle pigmentation
- Overall image quality assessment

**Provides structured output in expert format:**
```

## üîç Expert Analysis Tips

### Image Quality Requirements:
- **Minimum**: 400x300 pixels
- **Recommended**: 800x600 or higher
- **Best**: Side or front view with good lighting
- **Essential**: Clear visibility of head, body, and distinctive features

### Systematic Examination:
1. **Overall Assessment** - General build and obvious characteristics
2. **Head-to-Tail** - Systematic examination of each feature
3. **Distinctive Marks** - Unique identifying characteristics
4. **Breed Indicators** - Features that suggest specific breed groups
5. **Quality Check** - Assess confidence in observations

### Terminology Precision:
- Use specific color names (e.g., "reddish-brown" not "brown")
- Describe patterns accurately (spotted vs. patched vs. brindled)
- Note relative sizes (small/medium/large ears relative to head)
- Include directional information (horns curved backward vs. forward)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### Python Environment:
- Python 3.7+ (configured automatically)
- Required packages: `requests`, `Pillow`, `numpy`
- Virtual environment set up in `.venv/`

### System Setup:
```bash
# Environment is already configured!
# Just run the analysis tools:
python interactive_analyzer.py

# Or for batch processing:
python cattle_analyzer.py
```

## üìä Output Examples
